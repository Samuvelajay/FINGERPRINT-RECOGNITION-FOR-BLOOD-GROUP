# FINGERPRINT-RECOGNITION-FOR-BLOOD-GROUP
This project proposes a machine learning-based pipeline to predict blood groups from fingerprint images using Python. It employs SIFT for preprocessing, Density-Based K-Means for segmentation, HOG for feature extraction, and EfficientNet for classification. The system offers a non-invasive, efficient alternative to traditional blood tests.
